It was launched soon after, in January 2009.\n\n[Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-bitcoin) is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all [transactions](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-a-bitcoin-transaction-take) happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”\n\nSome concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the [first-ever cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-beginner-s-guide-to-investing-in-cryptocurrencies) to come into actual use."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2021, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.\n\nOn October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “[blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain).”\n\nJust two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the [genesis block](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/genesis-block), thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time.\n\nHowever, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.\n\nBitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What Makes Bitcoin Unique?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market.\n\nIt has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives. The emergence of the first cryptocurrency has created a conceptual and technological basis that subsequently inspired the development of thousands of competing projects.\n\n[The entire cryptocurrency market](https://coinmarketcap.com/) — now worth more than $2 trillion — is based on the idea realized by Bitcoin: money that can be sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world without reliance on trusted intermediaries, such as banks and financial services companies.\n\nThanks to its pioneering nature, BTC remains at the top of this energetic market after over a decade of existence. Even after Bitcoin has lost its undisputed dominance, it remains the largest [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), with a [market capitalization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/market-capitalization-market-cap-mcap) that surpassed the $1 trillion mark in 2021, after Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $64,863.10 on April 14, 2021. This is owing in large part to growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, and the ubiquitousness of platforms that provide use-cases for BTC: [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-a-bitcoin-wallet), exchanges, payment services, online games and more."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How Much Bitcoin Is in Circulation?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bitcoin’s [total supply](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) is limited by its software and will never exceed 21,000,000 coins. New coins are created during the process known as [“mining”](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin): as transactions are relayed across the network, they get picked up by miners and packaged into blocks, which are in turn protected by complex cryptographic calculations.\n\nAs compensation for spending their computational resources, the miners receive rewards for every block that they successfully add to the blockchain. At the moment of Bitcoin’s launch, the reward was 50 bitcoins per block: this number gets [halved](https://coinmarketcap.com/halving/bitcoin/) with every 210,000 new blocks mined — which takes the network roughly four years. As of 2020, the block reward has been halved three times and comprises 6.25 bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin has not been premined, meaning that no coins have been mined and/or distributed between the founders before it became available to the public. However, during the first few years of BTC’s existence, the competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million Bitcoin.\n\n[Mining Bitcoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mine-bitcoin) can be very profitable for miners, depending on the current hash rate and the price of Bitcoin. While the process of mining Bitcoins is complex, we discuss [how long it takes](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin) to mine one Bitcoin on CoinMarketCap [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/) — as we wrote above, mining Bitcoin is best understood as how long it takes to mine one block, as opposed to one Bitcoin. As of mid-September 2021, the Bitcoin mining reward is capped to 6.25 BTC after the [2020 halving](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-halvings-what-they-are-why-they-happen-and-why-you-should-care), which is roughly $299,200 in Bitcoin price today."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How Is the Bitcoin Network Secured?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bitcoin is secured with the [SHA-256 algorithm](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sha-256), which belongs to the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms, which is also used by its fork Bitcoin Cash ([BCH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/)), as well as several other cryptocurrencies."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What Is Bitcoin’s Role as a Store of Value?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bitcoin is the first decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency. One of its most important functions is that it is used as a decentralized store of value. In other words, it provides for ownership rights as a physical asset or as a unit of account. However, the latter store-of-value function has been debated. Many crypto enthusiasts and economists believe that high-scale adoption of the top currency will lead us to a new modern financial world where transaction amounts will be denominated in smaller units.\n\nThe smallest units of Bitcoin, 0.00000001 BTC, are called [Satoshis](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/satoshi-sats) (or Sats in short), in a nod to the pseudonymous creator. At Bitcoin price now, 1 Satoshi is equivalent to roughly $0.00048.\n\nThe top crypto is considered a store of value, like gold, for many — rather than a currency. This idea of the first cryptocurrency as a store of value, instead of a payment method, means that many people buy the crypto and hold onto it long-term (or HODL) rather than spending it on items like you would typically spend a dollar — treating it as digital gold."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How Is Bitcoin’s Technology Upgraded?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A [hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hard-fork-blockchain) is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade. For example, if users A and B are disagreeing on whether an incoming transaction is valid, a hard fork could make the transaction valid to users A and B, but not to user C.\n\nA hard fork is a protocol upgrade that is not backward compatible. This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain. The old blockchain will continue to exist and will continue to accept transactions, although it may be incompatible with other newer Bitcoin clients.\n\nA [soft fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/soft-fork-blockchain) is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules.\n\nSome examples of prominent cryptocurrencies that have undergone hard forks are the following: [Bitcoin’s hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-bitcoin-cash) that resulted in Bitcoin Cash, [Ethereum’s hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-vs-ethereum-classic) that resulted in Ethereum Classic.\n\nBitcoin Cash has been hard forked since its original forking, with the creation of Bitcoin SV. Read more about the difference between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-cash-vs-bitcoin-sv)."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What Is Taproot?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Taproot is a [soft fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/soft-fork-blockchain) that bundles together BIP 340, 341 and 342 and aims to improve the scalability, efficiency, and privacy of the blockchain by introducing several new features.\n\nThe two major changes are the introduction of the Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree (MAST) and Schnorr Signature. MAST introduces a condition allowing the sender and recipient of a transaction to sign off on its settlement together. Schnorr Signature allows users to aggregate several signatures into one for a single transaction. This results in [multi-signature](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/multisignature) transactions looking the same as regular transactions or more complex ones. By introducing this new address type, users can also save on transaction fees, as even complex transactions look like simple, single-signature ones.\n\nAlthough [HODL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hodl)ers will probably not notice a big impact, Taproot could become a key milestone to equipping the network with [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) functionality. In particular, Schnorr Signatures would lay the foundation for more complex applications to be built on top of the existing blockchain, as users start switching to Taproot addresses primarily. If adopted by users, Taproot could, in the long run, result in the network developing its own [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) ecosystem that rivals those on alternative blockchains like [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What Is the Lightning Network?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Lightning Network is an off-chain, layered payment protocol that operates bidirectional payment channels which allows instantaneous transfer with instant reconciliation. It enables private, high volume and trustless transactions between any two parties. The Lightning Network scales transaction capacity without incurring the costs associated with transactions and interventions on the underlying blockchain."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Who Are the Largest Corporate Holders of Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A few years ago, the idea that a publicly traded company might hold Bitcoin on its balance sheets seemed highly laughable. The flagship cryptocurrency was considered to be too volatile to be adopted by any serious business. Many top investors, including Warren Buffett, labeled the asset a “bubble waiting to pop.”\n\nThis negative sentiment appears to have been broken, with a number of corporate behemoths buying up Bitcoin since 2020. In particular, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy set the pace after it bought $425 million worth of Bitcoin in August and September 2020. Since then, many others have followed suit, including EV manufacturer [Tesla](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/tesla-has-made-100m-on-bitcoin-already-but-elon-musk-is-being-criticized).\n\nMicroStrategy has by far the largest Bitcoin portfolio held by any publicly-traded company. The business analytics platform has adopted Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset, aggressively buying the cryptocurrency through 2021 and 2022. As of August 30, 2022, the company had 129,699 Bitcoin in its reserve, equivalent to just over $2.5 billion.\n\nOther top corporate holders include Marathon Digital Holdings, with 10,054 BTC, Coinbase (9,000), Square Inc. (8,027), and Hut 8 Mining Corp. (7,078)."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is Bitcoin Political?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bitcoin is becoming more political by the day, particularly after El Salvador began accepting the currency as [legal tender](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/el-salvador-plans-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender-why-thats-a-big-deal).

Since the Bitcoin legal tender law was passed in September 2021, Bukele has also announced plans to build [Bitcoin City](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/el-salvador-to-build-world-s-first-bitcoin-city), a city fully based on mining Bitcoin with geothermal energy from volcanoes.\n\nCountries like [Mexico](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/mexico-has-no-plans-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender), [Russia](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/russia-says-it-wont-make-bitcoin-legal-tender-as-media-says-el-salvador-is-making-dangerous-gamble) and others have been rumored to be candidates also to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, but thus far, El Salvador stands alone.\n\nOn the flip side, countries like China have moved to heavily [clamp down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-price-falls-as-china-declares-all-crypto-transactions-are-illegal) on Bitcoin mining and trading activities. In May 2021, the Chinese government declared that all crypto-related transactions are illegal. This was followed by a heavy crackdown on Bitcoin mining operations, forcing many crypto-related businesses to flee to friendlier regions.\n\nSurprisingly, the anti-crypto stance of the Chinese government has done little to stop the industry. According to data by the [University of Cambridge](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map), China is now the second-biggest contributor to Bitcoin's global hash rate, only behind the United States."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How Much Is Bitcoin?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The current valuation of Bitcoin is constantly moving, all day every day.

Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”</p><p>Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-beginner-s-guide-to-investing-in-cryptocurrencies">first-ever cryptocurrency</a> to come into actual use.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sc-ef2fea42-0 knyKIQ"><div class="readmoreDesc" data-direction="ltr"><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 lmUuCf top"><h3 class="sc-65e7f566-0 iQQpxP base-text">Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin?</h3><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 eQBACe right"><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 hmbuiT"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="1em" width="1em" class="sc-65e7f566-0 eyXrOz c-i" loading="lazy" decode="async" priority="low"><use href="#chevronDown"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 ggPOQl hidden"><div style="padding-top:var(--c-space-100);display:block" class="sc-5f3326dd-0 cQTTgP"><div><p>Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2021, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.</p><p>On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain">blockchain</a>.”</p><p>Just two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/genesis-block">genesis block</a>, thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time.</p><p>However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.</p><p>Bitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sc-ef2fea42-0 knyKIQ"><div class="readmoreDesc" data-direction="ltr"><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 lmUuCf top"><h3 class="sc-65e7f566-0 iQQpxP base-text">What Makes Bitcoin Unique?</h3><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 eQBACe right"><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 hmbuiT"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="1em" width="1em" class="sc-65e7f566-0 eyXrOz c-i" loading="lazy" decode="async" priority="low"><use href="#chevronDown"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 ggPOQl hidden"><div style="padding-top:var(--c-space-100);display:block" class="sc-5f3326dd-0 cQTTgP"><div><p>Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market.</p><p>It has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives.

One of its most important functions is that it is used as a decentralized store of value. In other words, it provides for ownership rights as a physical asset or as a unit of account. However, the latter store-of-value function has been debated. Many crypto enthusiasts and economists believe that high-scale adoption of the top currency will lead us to a new modern financial world where transaction amounts will be denominated in smaller units.</p><p>The smallest units of Bitcoin, 0.00000001 BTC, are called <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/satoshi-sats">Satoshis</a> (or Sats in short), in a nod to the pseudonymous creator.

This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain. The old blockchain will continue to exist and will continue to accept transactions, although it may be incompatible with other newer Bitcoin clients.</p><p>A <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/soft-fork-blockchain">soft fork</a> is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid.

MAST introduces a condition allowing the sender and recipient of a transaction to sign off on its settlement together. Schnorr Signature allows users to aggregate several signatures into one for a single transaction. This results in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/multisignature">multi-signature</a> transactions looking the same as regular transactions or more complex ones.

When news stories started swirling regarding the possible negative effects of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, many became concerned about Bitcoin and criticized this energy usage. A report found that each Bitcoin transaction takes 1,173 KW hours of electricity, which can “power the typical American home for six weeks.” Another report calculates that the energy required by Bitcoin annually is more than the annual hourly energy usage of Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million.</p><p>The news has produced commentary from tech entrepreneurs to environmental activists to political leaders alike. In May 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk even stated that Tesla would no longer accept the cryptocurrency as payment, due to his concern regarding its environmental footprint. Though many of these individuals have condemned this issue and move on, some have prompted solutions: how do we make Bitcoin more energy efficient? Others have simply taken the defensive position, stating that the Bitcoin energy problem may be exaggerated.</p><p>At present, miners are heavily reliant on renewable energy sources, with estimates suggesting that Bitcoin’s use of renewable energy may span anywhere from 40-75%. However, to this point, critics claim that increasing Bitcoin’s renewable energy usage will take away from solar sources powering other sectors and industries like hospitals, factories or homes. The Bitcoin mining community also attests that the expansion of mining can help lead to the construction of new solar and wind farms in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, some who defend Bitcoin argue that the gold and banking sector — individually — consume twice the amount of energy as Bitcoin, making the criticism of Bitcoin’s energy consumption a nonstarter. Moreover, the energy consumption of Bitcoin can easily be tracked and traced, which the same cannot be said of the other two sectors. Those who defend Bitcoin also note that the complex validation process creates a more secure transaction system, which justifies the energy usage.</p><p>Another point that Bitcoin proponents make is that the energy usage required by Bitcoin is all-inclusive such that it encompasess the process of creating, securing, using and transporting Bitcoin. Whereas with other financial sectors, this is not the case. For example, when calculating the carbon footprint of a payment processing system like Visa, they fail to calculate the energy required to print money or power ATMs, or smartphones, bank branches, security vehicles, among other components in the payment processing and banking supply chain.</p><p>What exactly are governments and nonprofits doing to reduce Bitcoin energy consumption? Earlier this year in the U.S., a congressional hearing was held on the topic where politicians and tech figures discussed the future of crypto mining in the U.S, specifically highlighting their concerns regarding fossil fuel consumption. Leaders also discussed the current debate surrounding the coal-to-crypto trend, particularly regarding the number of coal plants in New York and Pennsylvania that are in the process of being repurposed into mining farms.</p><p>Aside from congressional hearings, there are private sector crypto initiatives dedicated to solving environmental issues such as the Crypto Climate Accord and Bitcoin Mining Council. In fact, the Crypto Climate Accord proposes a plan to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, And, due to the innovative potential of Bitcoin, it is reasonable to believe that such grand plans may be achieved.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sc-ef2fea42-0 knyKIQ"><div class="readmoreDesc" data-direction="ltr"><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 lmUuCf top"><h3 class="sc-65e7f566-0 iQQpxP base-text">Crypto Wallets</h3><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 eQBACe right"><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 hmbuiT"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="1em" width="1em" class="sc-65e7f566-0 eyXrOz c-i" loading="lazy" decode="async" priority="low"><use href="#chevronDown"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class="sc-65e7f566-0 ggPOQl hidden"><div style="padding-top:var(--c-space-100);display:block" class="sc-5f3326dd-0 cQTTgP"><div><p>The most popular wallets for cryptocurrency include both hot and cold wallets.

It provides insights into Bitcoin market cycles by assessing miner revenue and its implications for price movements.\\n\\nThe Puell Multiple is calculated as daily Bitcoin issuance (in US$) divided by the 365 day moving average of daily Bitcoin issuance (in US$). The goal is to refine Bitcoin cycle analysis by focusing on miner revenue trends and their impact on market behavior. \\n\\nMany analysts believe that it helps determine Bitcoin’s bull and bear market phases based on miner profitability. A low Puell Multiple value suggests that mining is unprofitable, leading to miner capitulation, which is a common bottoming signal. Since miner rewards are cut in half during halvings, the Puell Model can be useful to help analyze post-halving supply shocks.","crypto_market_overview_market_cycle_q_and_a_5":"What Is The Pi Cycle Top Indicator?","crypto_market_overview_market_cycle_q_and_a_6":"The Pi Cycle Indicator is a popular on-chain crypto tool used to predict the top of Bitcoin market cycles. It gained attention for accurately signaling the top of the 2013 and 2017 bull markets, and it gave a notable signal in April 2021, just before Bitcoin's sharp correction. However, it failed to catch the November 2021 peak.","crypto_market_overview_market_cycle_q_and_a_7":"How Is The Pi Cycle Top Indicator Calculated?","crypto_market_overview_market_cycle_q_and_a_8":"Two simple moving averages of the Bitcoin price are required. The first is the 111 day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The second is the 350 day Simple Moving Average multiplied by 2. Please note that this is twice the value and not a doubled price. \\n\\nAs explained above, we have seen in the past that when the 111 day moving average crossed upwards through the 350 day moving average x 2, it coincided with the peak price of Bitcoin.","crypto_market_overview_market_cycle_q_and_a_9":"How Should You Use The Pi Cycle Signal?","crypto_market_overview_market_cycle_q_and_a_10":"The Pi Cycle is considered to be relatively easy to calculate, which makes it popular, but it is also considered to be limited and should be used in conjunction with other signals. Since the Pi Cycle does not signal dips or bottoms and by using moving averages it is a trailing indicator, many traders in the crypto community consider it to be a potential warning signal.","market_cycle_cdp_header":"{{coin_name}} Market Cycles","market_cycles_cdp_tab":"Market Cycles","mkt_cycle_rainbow_chart_title":"Bitcoin Rainbow Price Chart Indicator","mkt_cycle_rainbow_chart_tooltip":"The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart uses a logarithmic growth curve with color bands to illustrate market sentiment and highlight potential buy or sell zones.

Chainlink stands to benefit the most from emerging blockchain-industry trends, such as stablecoin adoption, real-world asset tokenization, and institutional adoption of blockchain technology. Chainlink is powered by the LINK token, which is used to pay for platform services and secure the network’s proper functioning. Chainlink leverages a novel fee model where offchain and onchain revenue from enterprise adoption is converted to LINK tokens and stored in a strategic Chainlink Reserve.\n\nChainlink is at the forefront of financial innovation and the global tokenization trend. Traditional financial institutions and infrastructures, such as Swift, DTCC, Euroclear, J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, Central Bank of Brazil, UBS, SBI, Fidelity International, ANZ,  and many others are adopting Chainlink as fundamental infrastructure as they move toward tokenizing trillions onchain. Demand for Chainlink has already generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue across a variety of traditional and decentralized use cases.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Chainlink?\n\nSergey Nazarov is a co-founder and CEO at Chainlink Labs. He graduated with a degree in business administration from New York University, with a focus on philosophy and administration. His professional career began as a teaching fellow at NYU Stern School of Business. In 2009, Nazarov co-founded ExistLocal, a peer-to-peer marketplace for authentic local experiences. Nazarov has worked in the blockchain industry since 2010, giving him one of the longest-running tenures of any technologist in the industry, which began only a year earlier in 2009 with Bitcoin’s creation. Sergey initially built some of the first smart contracts before blockchains like Ethereum were even a concept and went on to invent Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) in the Chainlink whitepaper. In 2014, he also co-founded CryptaMail, a completely decentralized, blockchain-based email service.\n\nIn 2014, Nazarov teamed up with Steve Ellis and launched SmartContract, a platform that brings smart contracts to life by connecting them to external data and widely accepted bank payments. SmartContract was one of the entrepreneurial ventures that led Sergey Nazarov to the founding of Chainlink.\n\nWhat Makes Chainlink Unique?\n\nChainlink is the only all-in-one platform that fulfills the requirements of any institutional blockchain use case. The Chainlink platform enables developers and institutions to access all the critical data, interoperability, compute, compliance, privacy, and legacy-system connectivity required for advanced blockchain applications that link the onchain and offchain worlds. Chainlink solves four fundamental problems for institutions interacting with tokenized assets:\n\nThe data problem. Tokenized assets need real-world information to be usable in transactions, such as market pricing, reference data, and proof of reserves data. Chainlink is the market leader in bringing real-world data onchain securely and accurately.\nThe liquidity problem. Financial institutions need tokenized assets that can be securely accessed and moved across blockchain networks in order to maximize liquidity. Chainlink CCIP is the only cross-chain interoperability standard that securely connects any public or private blockchain, opening up global markets for tokenized assets.\nThe synchronization problem. Tokenized assets must remain synchronized with legacy systems once issued across multiple chains. Chainlink is the only platform that offers reliable offchain data, system connectivity, and secure cross-chain interoperability, enabling a Unified Golden Record that stays with assets anywhere.\nThe compliance problem. Regulated institutions require compliance enforcement capabilities such as identity verification (KYC), risk screening (AML), exploit protection, and asset-specific restrictions. The Chainlink Automated Compliance Engine extends existing financial infrastructure for identity and compliance data to blockchains and tokenized assets.\n\nSince launch, the Chainlink standard has securely enabled tens of trillions in transaction value across dozens of blockchains and published tens of billions of verified messages onchain. Chainlink actively secures the large majority of DeFi protocols across different blockchains, with near total dominance on Ethereum. As a chain-agnostic platform with thousands of users across the world’s largest financial institutions and DeFi protocols, Chainlink accelerates the adoption of blockchain ecosystems and is used by tens of thousands of developers, including protocols such as Aave, GMX, Lido, and many more.\n\nChainlink and Google, Introduction of Staking in 2022, and Introduction of the Chainlink Reserve in 2025.\n\nChainlink has grown from aggregating and providing cryptocurrency price data to DeFi protocols like Aave, to a lot more. The ecosystem currently access over 1B data points, securing over $95B in value across 1,000 project integrations with 700 oracle networks. Mainstream organizations like Swift, J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Euroclear have partnered with Chainlink. Another win Chainlink has secured is onboarding Eric Schmidt, ex-Google chairman and CEO, as a technical advisor to the oracle platform. According to Schmidt, \"Chainlink is a secret ingredient to unlocking the potential of smart contract platforms and revolutionizing business and society,\" and he is interested in helping Chainlink build a world powered by truth. Schmidt joins other notable Chainlink advisors, including former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner and DocuSign co-founder Tom Gonser.\n\nIn 2025, Chainlink launched the Chainlink Reserve is a strategic onchain reserve of LINK\ndesigned to support the long-term growth and sustainability of the Chainlink Network by accumulating LINK tokens using offchain revenue from large enterprises that are adopting the Chainlink standard and from onchain service usage.\n\nRelated Pages:\n\nRead more about Oracles and learn how they work.\n\nFind out more in our deep dive on Chainlink and our technical analysis on Chainlink price now!\n\nLearn more about Decentralized Data Governance.\n\nWant to keep track of Chainlink price live?

The network launched in 2014 with the purpose of connecting the world's financial systems by offering a protocol for payment providers and financial institutions that facilitates near-instant global payments and currency exchanges. In 2024, Stellar released protocol 20, enabling full-featured smart contracts to the network. The network is transforming international payments and remittances through safer, faster, and more affordable solutions, and connecting real-world assets to DeFi to enable comprehensive everyday financial services.\n\nThe Stellar network’s native digital currency - Lumens (“XLM”) - is used to pay the network’s transaction fees.  (XLM can also be used as an intermediate currency for operations. How it works: the protocol converts money in a few seconds, first into XLM, and then into the requested currency.)\n\nStellar's unique Proof-of-Agreement (PoA) consensus mechanism –  the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)– differs from both Proof of Stake and Proof of Work. SCP is designed to secure the network through reputation rather than through computing resources or staked crypto tokens. All Stellar validators are required to have a publicly-accessible and verifiable record identifying themselves, building trust within the network. By design, Stellar does not provide onchain financial incentives to run validators, nor does it rely on stake or hash power to secure the network. Instead organizations run nodes for network benefit and collaborate to reach a network-wide agreement about the validity of transactions.\n\nStellar is a proven platform for asset issuance; many well-known institutions select Stellar as their preferred network for bringing real-world assets(RWAs) onchain. The network's speed and low fees, robust asset issuance framework, compliance tools, and anchor network provide financial institutions the infrastructure needed to tokenize assets while maintaining regulatory compliance. This approach has attracted significant RWA volume, with hundreds of millions of dollars in stablecoins, tokenized funds, and other real-world assets flowing through the network daily. It has also led to groundbreaking implementations like Franklin Templeton's BENJI fund, the first U.S. registered money market fund on a public blockchain.\n\nStellar's smart contract platform extends the network's capabilities to support sophisticated financial applications while maintaining Stellar's core principles of efficiency and accessibility. Built with Rust and WebAssembly, Soroban prioritizes performance through features like deterministic concurrency and multi-dimensional fees, enabling complex operations with predictable costs and sub-five-second finality. Security is foundational, with Rust's memory safety guarantees, no-reentrancy design, and an authorization-required framework that makes it difficult to introduce vulnerabilities. Unlike general-purpose platforms, Soroban is purpose-built for financial applications, supporting everything from decentralized exchanges and lending protocols to tokenized assets. This aligns with Stellar's purpose to connect traditional finance with blockchain technology, providing developers the tools to build real-world everyday financial services that are scalable, secure, and accessible to users worldwide.","score":4.3,"watchCount":"1101126","price":0.23296747708061166,"percentChange24h":-1.58924264,"percentChange7d":-3.96780039,"percentChange30d":-12.1505326,"shareTags":"2017/18 Alt season,Binance Ecosystem,Binance Listing","bestCrypto":false},{"id":24478,"name":"Pepe","slug":"pepe","symbol":"PEPE","coinSummary":"PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum.

It has induced what some may dub a \"memecoin season,\" causing other memecoins — some launched within hours — to go on spectacular pumps and just as astounding dumps. It remains to be seen if PEPE and other memecoins will go on to new highs, although that is certainly the hope of many believers waiting for the coming BTC halving cycle praying for a Bull Run.\n\nThe PEPE roadmap features three phases, where phase one includes listing on CoinMarketCap, and getting $PEPE trending on Twitter, while phase two includes listing on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and phase three includes “tier 1” exchange listings and what the team terms a “meme takeover.”","score":4.27,"watchCount":"659689","price":0.000004318653595532428,"percentChange24h":-0.66848731,"percentChange7d":-6.02139463,"percentChange30d":-14.73491622,"shareTags":"Binance Ecosystem,Binance Listing","bestCrypto":true,"bestCryptoInfo":{"bestCryptoSeq":5,"titleType":"6","subPointType":"7","subPointValue":"31"}},{"id":4642,"name":"Hedera","slug":"hedera","symbol":"HBAR","coinSummary":"Hedera is the most used, sustainable, enterprise-grade public network for the decentralized economy that allows individuals and businesses to create powerful decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nIt is designed to be a fairer, more efficient system that eliminates some of the limitations that older blockchain-based platforms face — such as slow performance and instability.\n\nIt was funded through an initial coin offering (ICO) in August 2018 and first launched open access to its mainnet just over a year later in September 2019. As part of the ICO, investors were able to purchase the platform’s native utility token (HBAR) at the lowest possible pricing.\n\nThe HBAR token has a dual role within the Hedera public network.\n\nFirst and foremost, HBAR the fuel that powers Hedera services, such as smart contracts, file storage and regular transactions. Second, it's used to help secure the network, since HBAR users can stake their tokens to assist with maintaining the integrity of the platform.\n\nHedera (HBAR) is the native cryptocurrency of Hedera Hashgraph, a platform that is positioned as an alternative to traditional blockchain technology and aims to excel in speed, efficiency and security.\n\nOlder blockchains tend to use a consensus mechanism like proof-of-work (PoW) to validate transactions, while younger blockchains opted for proof-of-stake (PoS). The Hedera Hashgraph system has a structure that was created from scratch particularly for the project. Hedera is based on a PoS model that is believed to increase the efficiency of transaction verification in the network, provide a high level of security, and protect the network from hacker attacks. Its ecosystem has the underlying hashgraph consensus algorithm and the global enterprise governing body.\n\nHedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology (DLT). According to the project website, Hedera differs from other blockchains because it uses a new consensus algorithm called hashgraph. It intends to process and execute transactions faster, eliminate delays, and smooth out the TPS (transactions per second) indicator. Hashgraph is claimed to be an upgrade in transaction speed, cost, and scalability.\n\nCore network services by Hedera:\n\nConsensus Service (HCS). With HCS, clients send messages to the network to negotiate consensus timestamping and order. In this case, the state is stored offline, and users can define privacy and access control.\n\nHedera Token Service (HTS). Thanks to HTS, token creation and management are available to customers. It supports built-in tokenization.\n\nThe goal of Hedera’s hashgraph is to increase the speed of transactions. Moreover, the network is also focused on high-volume operations: micropayments, data integrity and tokenization.\n\nLike the EVM, the Hedera network maintains a virtual machine that writes smart contracts in the Solidity programming language. On top of that, Hedera offers a set of built-in KYC and AML checks.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, Hedera is a form of distributed ledger technology. It is a hashgraph, or consensus algorithm, where users agree on the order in which transactions should be performed. However, Hedera is not exactly a blockchain. It has its own distinctiveness and works differently. With hashgraph, all transaction branches are merged, no block equivalent is thrown away, and each is used to reach consensus.\n\nOne of the most noticeable features of the network is the Gossip-about-Gossip protocol. According to Dr. Leemon Baird, Hedera's inventor, within the system nodes randomly transmit data about themselves to other nodes via hashgraph using the Gossip protocol. Soon, all nodes in a cluster become familiar with each other. Then a certain data structure is formed. It consists of a payload of transactions, a timestamp, a digital signature, and hashes to the previous structures.\n\nHBAR is Hedera's native token that powers applications on the Hedera network. HBAR is utilized to pay for network services, transaction fees, in-app payments and micropayments. Developers can pay network fees with HBAR tokens, namely: work with smart contracts, file storage and currency exchange. HBAR is used to incentivize and pay network nodes.\n\nHedera Hashgraph has a decentralized governance system that is set apart. All critical decisions about pricing policy, software updates, and wealth management are made by the Governing Council.","score":4.21,"watchCount":"801237","price":0.12003896347976646,"percentChange24h":-2.76915416,"percentChange7d":-10.67684923,"percentChange30d":-23.73813377,"shareTags":"Layer 1,Binance Ecosystem,Binance Listing","bestCrypto":false},{"id":2,"name":"Litecoin","slug":"litecoin","symbol":"LTC","coinSummary":"Litecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency that was designed to provide fast, secure and low-cost payments by leveraging the unique properties of blockchain technology.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Litecoin.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was created based on the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol, but it differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used, hard cap, block transaction times and a few other factors.

The main goal is to help content creators (who receive only a small part of the income) and encourage them with more rewards for their work. How: invite content consumers to reward content makers directly (without intermediaries like YouTube, Facebook or Apple).\n\nThe TRON software supports smart contracts, various kinds of blockchain systems, and decentralized applications aka dApps. The cryptocurrency platform uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin (BTC), namely UTXO. Transactions take place in a public ledger, where users can track the history of operations.\n\nTherefore, the platform was built to create a decentralized Internet and serves as a tool for developers to create dApps, acting as an alternative to Ethereum. Anyone can create dApps on the TRON network, offer content, and in return receive digital assets as compensation for their efforts.

[cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies) originally described in a 2008 [whitepaper](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitepaper) by a person, or group of people, using the alias [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto). It was launched soon after, in January 2009.\n\n[Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-bitcoin) is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all [transactions](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-a-bitcoin-transaction-take) happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”\n\nSome concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the [first-ever cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-beginner-s-guide-to-investing-in-cryptocurrencies) to come into actual use.","isQ":true},{"q":"Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin?","a":"Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2021, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.\n\nOn October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “[blockchain](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain).”\n\nJust two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the [genesis block](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/genesis-block), thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time.\n\nHowever, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.\n\nBitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.","isQ":true},{"q":"What Makes Bitcoin Unique?","a":"Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market.\n\nIt has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives. The emergence of the first cryptocurrency has created a conceptual and technological basis that subsequently inspired the development of thousands of competing projects.\n\n[The entire cryptocurrency market](https://coinmarketcap.com/) — now worth more than $2 trillion — is based on the idea realized by Bitcoin: money that can be sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world without reliance on trusted intermediaries, such as banks and financial services companies.\n\nThanks to its pioneering nature, BTC remains at the top of this energetic market after over a decade of existence. Even after Bitcoin has lost its undisputed dominance, it remains the largest [cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrencies), with a [market capitalization](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/market-capitalization-market-cap-mcap) that surpassed the $1 trillion mark in 2021, after Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $64,863.10 on April 14, 2021. This is owing in large part to growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, and the ubiquitousness of platforms that provide use-cases for BTC: [wallets](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-use-a-bitcoin-wallet), exchanges, payment services, online games and more.","isQ":true},{"q":"How Much Bitcoin Is in Circulation?","a":"Bitcoin’s [total supply](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics) is limited by its software and will never exceed 21,000,000 coins. New coins are created during the process known as [“mining”](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin): as transactions are relayed across the network, they get picked up by miners and packaged into blocks, which are in turn protected by complex cryptographic calculations.\n\nAs compensation for spending their computational resources, the miners receive rewards for every block that they successfully add to the blockchain. At the moment of Bitcoin’s launch, the reward was 50 bitcoins per block: this number gets [halved](https://coinmarketcap.com/halving/bitcoin/) with every 210,000 new blocks mined — which takes the network roughly four years. As of 2020, the block reward has been halved three times and comprises 6.25 bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin has not been premined, meaning that no coins have been mined and/or distributed between the founders before it became available to the public. However, during the first few years of BTC’s existence, the competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million Bitcoin.\n\n[Mining Bitcoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mine-bitcoin) can be very profitable for miners, depending on the current hash rate and the price of Bitcoin. While the process of mining Bitcoins is complex, we discuss [how long it takes](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-mine-one-bitcoin) to mine one Bitcoin on CoinMarketCap [Alexandria](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/) — as we wrote above, mining Bitcoin is best understood as how long it takes to mine one block, as opposed to one Bitcoin. As of mid-September 2021, the Bitcoin mining reward is capped to 6.25 BTC after the [2020 halving](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-halvings-what-they-are-why-they-happen-and-why-you-should-care), which is roughly $299,200 in Bitcoin price today.","isQ":true},{"q":"How Is the Bitcoin Network Secured?","a":"Bitcoin is secured with the [SHA-256 algorithm](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/sha-256), which belongs to the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms, which is also used by its fork Bitcoin Cash ([BCH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/)), as well as several other cryptocurrencies.","isQ":true},{"q":"What Is Bitcoin’s Role as a Store of Value?","a":"Bitcoin is the first decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency. One of its most important functions is that it is used as a decentralized store of value. In other words, it provides for ownership rights as a physical asset or as a unit of account. However, the latter store-of-value function has been debated. Many crypto enthusiasts and economists believe that high-scale adoption of the top currency will lead us to a new modern financial world where transaction amounts will be denominated in smaller units.\n\nThe smallest units of Bitcoin, 0.00000001 BTC, are called [Satoshis](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/satoshi-sats) (or Sats in short), in a nod to the pseudonymous creator. At Bitcoin price now, 1 Satoshi is equivalent to roughly $0.00048.\n\nThe top crypto is considered a store of value, like gold, for many — rather than a currency. This idea of the first cryptocurrency as a store of value, instead of a payment method, means that many people buy the crypto and hold onto it long-term (or HODL) rather than spending it on items like you would typically spend a dollar — treating it as digital gold.","isQ":true},{"q":"How Is Bitcoin’s Technology Upgraded?","a":"A [hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hard-fork-blockchain) is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade. For example, if users A and B are disagreeing on whether an incoming transaction is valid, a hard fork could make the transaction valid to users A and B, but not to user C.\n\nA hard fork is a protocol upgrade that is not backward compatible. This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain. The old blockchain will continue to exist and will continue to accept transactions, although it may be incompatible with other newer Bitcoin clients.\n\nA [soft fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/soft-fork-blockchain) is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules.\n\nSome examples of prominent cryptocurrencies that have undergone hard forks are the following: [Bitcoin’s hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-bitcoin-cash) that resulted in Bitcoin Cash, [Ethereum’s hard fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereum-vs-ethereum-classic) that resulted in Ethereum Classic.\n\nBitcoin Cash has been hard forked since its original forking, with the creation of Bitcoin SV. Read more about the difference between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-cash-vs-bitcoin-sv).","isQ":true},{"q":"What Is Taproot?","a":"Taproot is a [soft fork](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/soft-fork-blockchain) that bundles together BIP 340, 341 and 342 and aims to improve the scalability, efficiency, and privacy of the blockchain by introducing several new features.\n\nThe two major changes are the introduction of the Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree (MAST) and Schnorr Signature. MAST introduces a condition allowing the sender and recipient of a transaction to sign off on its settlement together. Schnorr Signature allows users to aggregate several signatures into one for a single transaction. This results in [multi-signature](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/multisignature) transactions looking the same as regular transactions or more complex ones. By introducing this new address type, users can also save on transaction fees, as even complex transactions look like simple, single-signature ones.\n\nAlthough [HODL](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hodl)ers will probably not notice a big impact, Taproot could become a key milestone to equipping the network with [smart contract](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract) functionality. In particular, Schnorr Signatures would lay the foundation for more complex applications to be built on top of the existing blockchain, as users start switching to Taproot addresses primarily. If adopted by users, Taproot could, in the long run, result in the network developing its own [DeFi](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi) ecosystem that rivals those on alternative blockchains like [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).","isQ":true},{"q":"What Is the Lightning Network?","a":"The Lightning Network is an off-chain, layered payment protocol that operates bidirectional payment channels which allows instantaneous transfer with instant reconciliation. It enables private, high volume and trustless transactions between any two parties. The Lightning Network scales transaction capacity without incurring the costs associated with transactions and interventions on the underlying blockchain.","isQ":true},{"q":"Who Are the Largest Corporate Holders of Bitcoin?","a":"A few years ago, the idea that a publicly traded company might hold Bitcoin on its balance sheets seemed highly laughable. The flagship cryptocurrency was considered to be too volatile to be adopted by any serious business. Many top investors, including Warren Buffett, labeled the asset a “bubble waiting to pop.”\n\nThis negative sentiment appears to have been broken, with a number of corporate behemoths buying up Bitcoin since 2020. In particular, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy set the pace after it bought $425 million worth of Bitcoin in August and September 2020. Since then, many others have followed suit, including EV manufacturer [Tesla](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/tesla-has-made-100m-on-bitcoin-already-but-elon-musk-is-being-criticized).\n\nMicroStrategy has by far the largest Bitcoin portfolio held by any publicly-traded company. The business analytics platform has adopted Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset, aggressively buying the cryptocurrency through 2021 and 2022. As of August 30, 2022, the company had 129,699 Bitcoin in its reserve, equivalent to just over $2.5 billion.\n\nOther top corporate holders include Marathon Digital Holdings, with 10,054 BTC, Coinbase (9,000), Square Inc. (8,027), and Hut 8 Mining Corp. (7,078).","isQ":true},{"q":"Is Bitcoin Political?","a":"Bitcoin is becoming more political by the day, particularly after El Salvador began accepting the currency as [legal tender](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/el-salvador-plans-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender-why-thats-a-big-deal). The country's president, Nayib Bukele, announced and implemented the decision almost unilaterally, dismissing criticism from [his citizens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-atm-set-on-fire-as-el-salvador-marks-independence-day), the [Bank of England](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bank-of-england-criticizes-el-salvador-over-bitcoin), the [IMF](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/imf-warns-that-el-salvadors-plan-to-adopt-bitcoin-has-risks), [Vitalik Buterin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/reckless-buterin-attacks-el-salvador-s-president) and many others. Since the Bitcoin legal tender law was passed in September 2021, Bukele has also announced plans to build [Bitcoin City](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/el-salvador-to-build-world-s-first-bitcoin-city), a city fully based on mining Bitcoin with geothermal energy from volcanoes.\n\nCountries like [Mexico](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/mexico-has-no-plans-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender), [Russia](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/russia-says-it-wont-make-bitcoin-legal-tender-as-media-says-el-salvador-is-making-dangerous-gamble) and others have been rumored to be candidates also to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, but thus far, El Salvador stands alone.\n\nOn the flip side, countries like China have moved to heavily [clamp down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-price-falls-as-china-declares-all-crypto-transactions-are-illegal) on Bitcoin mining and trading activities. In May 2021, the Chinese government declared that all crypto-related transactions are illegal. This was followed by a heavy crackdown on Bitcoin mining operations, forcing many crypto-related businesses to flee to friendlier regions.\n\nSurprisingly, the anti-crypto stance of the Chinese government has done little to stop the industry. According to data by the [University of Cambridge](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map), China is now the second-biggest contributor to Bitcoin's global hash rate, only behind the United States.","isQ":true},{"q":"How Much Is Bitcoin?","a":"The current valuation of Bitcoin is constantly moving, all day every day. It is a truly global asset. From a start of under one cent per coin, BTC has risen in price by thousands of percent to the numbers you see above. The prices of all cryptocurrencies are quite volatile, meaning that anyone’s understanding of how much Bitcoin is will change by the minute. However, there are times when different countries and exchanges show different prices and understanding how much Bitcoin is will be a function of a person’s location.","isQ":true},{"q":"Where Can You Buy Bitcoin (BTC)?","a":"Bitcoin is, in many regards, almost synonymous with cryptocurrency, which means that you can [buy Bitcoin](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-Bitcoin) on virtually every crypto exchange — both for fiat money and other cryptocurrencies.

When news stories started swirling regarding the possible negative effects of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, many became concerned about Bitcoin and criticized this energy usage. A report found that each Bitcoin transaction takes 1,173 KW hours of electricity, which can “power the typical American home for six weeks.” Another report calculates that the energy required by Bitcoin annually is more than the annual hourly energy usage of Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million.\n\nThe news has produced commentary from tech entrepreneurs to environmental activists to political leaders alike. In May 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk even stated that Tesla would no longer accept the cryptocurrency as payment, due to his concern regarding its environmental footprint. Though many of these individuals have condemned this issue and move on, some have prompted solutions: how do we make Bitcoin more energy efficient? Others have simply taken the defensive position, stating that the Bitcoin energy problem may be exaggerated.\n\nAt present, miners are heavily reliant on renewable energy sources, with estimates suggesting that Bitcoin’s use of renewable energy may span anywhere from 40-75%. However, to this point, critics claim that increasing Bitcoin’s renewable energy usage will take away from solar sources powering other sectors and industries like hospitals, factories or homes. The Bitcoin mining community also attests that the expansion of mining can help lead to the construction of new solar and wind farms in the future.\n\nFurthermore, some who defend Bitcoin argue that the gold and banking sector — individually — consume twice the amount of energy as Bitcoin, making the criticism of Bitcoin’s energy consumption a nonstarter. Moreover, the energy consumption of Bitcoin can easily be tracked and traced, which the same cannot be said of the other two sectors. Those who defend Bitcoin also note that the complex validation process creates a more secure transaction system, which justifies the energy usage.\n\nAnother point that Bitcoin proponents make is that the energy usage required by Bitcoin is all-inclusive such that it encompasess the process of creating, securing, using and transporting Bitcoin. Whereas with other financial sectors, this is not the case. For example, when calculating the carbon footprint of a payment processing system like Visa, they fail to calculate the energy required to print money or power ATMs, or smartphones, bank branches, security vehicles, among other components in the payment processing and banking supply chain.\n\nWhat exactly are governments and nonprofits doing to reduce Bitcoin energy consumption? Earlier this year in the U.S., a congressional hearing was held on the topic where politicians and tech figures discussed the future of crypto mining in the U.S, specifically highlighting their concerns regarding fossil fuel consumption. Leaders also discussed the current debate surrounding the coal-to-crypto trend, particularly regarding the number of coal plants in New York and Pennsylvania that are in the process of being repurposed into mining farms.\n\nAside from congressional hearings, there are private sector crypto initiatives dedicated to solving environmental issues such as the Crypto Climate Accord and Bitcoin Mining Council. In fact, the Crypto Climate Accord proposes a plan to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, And, due to the innovative potential of Bitcoin, it is reasonable to believe that such grand plans may be achieved.","isQ":false},{"q":"Crypto Wallets","a":"The most popular wallets for cryptocurrency include both hot and cold wallets.
